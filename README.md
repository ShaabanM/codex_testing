This repository demonstrates a simple object-oriented data model called
**AgentLogOntology** for describing autonomous-agent execution logs. It
includes a parser for the OpenAI ``agent-traces`` JSON schema and a small
Tkinter GUI to browse logs.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (just Tkinter, which is included with Python).
2. Run ``python demo.py`` to load ``sample_agent_trace.json`` and open the GUI.
